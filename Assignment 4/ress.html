                    Pakistan has a huge potential for generating renewable energy from sources such as solar, wind,
                    water and biomass.Considering the
                    growing demand of energy in the country, solar energy can prove to be an effective alternative.We
                    are offering complete soloutions
                    and services in the field of solar.</p>
                <h4 class="subh">Residential:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Residential users have distinct patterns of using electricity.Whether you are living in upscale
                    housing societies where there is a
                    continuous supply of power from the grid or in an area which faces severe load shedding.For clients
                    in areas facing severe load
                    shedding, we not only help you significantly lower your electricity bills but also ensure that you
                    get uninterrupted power supply 24
                    hours a day! Our solar technology will power your home using the sun during the day and will turn
                    into a UPS after sunset.At the
                    other end of the spectrum are people who have shifted to gen-sets to power the entire household.
                    These consumers do not lead a
                    restricted life-style but in fact have their entire household running on petrol/diesel gen-sets.
                    Using a Solar Solution these
                    consumers can Lead the same un-restricted lifestyle with Generating power using solar energy, which
                    is cheaper and renewable
                    No hassle of re-fueling the system as it is self-sustaining,Cleaner energy with No air or noise
                    pollution.The system is good for over
                    25 years.</p>
                <h4 class="subh">Industrial & Commercial:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Many large businesses have already started using solar energy to run their industries and others are
                    willing to adopt the same after
                    the reduction in capital bill.Power generation through Diesel causes operational expenditure.Cost of
                    fuel and maintenance of these
                    plants causes the cost of production to rise rendering a loss in competitive advantages.Experts
                    suggest that per unit cost us Rs. 18
                    on oil and Rs. 6-8 on solar.One-time investment in solar will serve you for multiple years with
                    minimal maintenance cost,zero cost of
                    re-fueling and Green & clean energy with reduction in carbon footprint.Solar Systems can be designed
                    to ensure a payback period of as
                    early as 5-6 years.And after that, the next 19-20 years are free of cost for the client as we use
                    solar panels with a lifespan of
                    minimum twenty five years.We provide Off-Grid and Hybrid solutions to our clients in the commercial
                    sector, depending upon the client
                    requirements.These clients may fall in any of the following categories:-

                <h4 class="subh">Offices:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    We offer products that will ensure uninterrupted power supply to critical appliances such as
                    laptops, desktops, printers, lights,
                    fans, etc. We can even power energy efficient Air Conditioners and other equipment if significant
                    space is available.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subh">Banks:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    As with any customer satisfaction driven business, it is imperative for banks to offer service where
                    backend issues are not visible
                    to the client. In current environment most bank branches are operating on gensets. Furthermore ATMs
                    have to be up and running 24
                    hours a day. The high opex cost of diesel may be justified during the day when customers traffic is
                    high at the branches, but there
                    is no reason to incur such costs when only ATMs have to be operational after business hours.
                    Some banks have switched to UPS systems for continuous operation of ATMs. While this is more
                    efficient than diesel gensets, banks are
                    still paying a high per unit price to WAPDA than solar. For this reason we believe that solar is the
                    best solution for critical
                    operations of the banks and their ATMS.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subh">Healthcare:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Perhaps no other sector requires uninterrupted power supply more than healthcare. Currently all
                    major hospitals, labs and clinics
                    have significant genset costs. While some have opted for UPS systems for critical system backups. We
                    believe we can help with that.
                    We can offer systems that will significantly lower operational expenditure and use solar technology
                    with existing resources to offer
                    Multisource Integrated Systems (MIS) which will ensure power at all hours during the day.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subh">Educational Institutes:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Educational institutes have high lighting needs. This often translates into high operational
                    expenditure. We can assist in
                    significantly lowering these operational expenditures by combining a variety of efficient energy
                    products such as LEDs with our solar
                    technology.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subh">Solar Street Lights:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Solar Street Lights are powered by photovoltic panels generally mounted on the light structure.The
                    solar modules collects sunlight and converts sunlight into electricity, which charges the
                    batteries.At night the light turns on automatically, using the electricity stored in the batteries.
                    Solar street lights are designed to work throughout the night. Many can stay lit for more than one
                    night if the sun is not available for a couple of days.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subh">Agricultural:</h4>
                <p class="introPara">
                    Being an agricultural country, Pakistan has a large number of tube wells installed in rural areas
                    which run either on electricity or
                    diesel Generators. Both these power sources are inefficient and very costly. The recent power crisis
                    and high cost of diesel fuel has
                    led many of the farms to opt for solar tube wells.
                    Solar tube well in Pakistan is a new phenomenon and we at SIMTEK believe that these are the future
                    of Pakistan’s economy.
                    One-time investment in such a solution will serve you for multiple years with minimal maintenance
                    cost and zero cost of re-fueling.
